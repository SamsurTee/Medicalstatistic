<h1>Interactive Medical Statistics Module Pack</h1>
<p>This module pack is designed to engage students with interactive, hands-on exercises, an AI-assisted activity, and a quiz. Students can expand each section to explore code, instructions, and tasks.</p>

<h2>1. Interactive SPSS/R Exercises</h2>
<details>
<summary>Exercise 1 – Descriptive Statistics & Graphs</summary>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> A researcher measures blood pressure, weight and height for 100 adults.</p>
<p><strong>Variables:</strong> Age (years), Sex (Male/Female), Weight_kg, Height_cm, SystolicBP, DiastolicBP.</p>
<p><strong>R Code:</strong></p>
<pre>set.seed(42)
n <- 100
data1 <- data.frame(
  Age = sample(20:70, n, replace=TRUE),
  Sex = sample(c("Male","Female"), n, replace=TRUE),
  Weight_kg = round(rnorm(n, 70, 12), 1),
  Height_cm = round(rnorm(n, 170, 10), 1),
  SystolicBP = round(rnorm(n, 120, 15), 1),
  DiastolicBP = round(rnorm(n, 80, 10), 1)
)
write.csv(data1, "exercise1.csv", row.names=FALSE)</pre>
<p><strong>SPSS Instructions:</strong> Import <em>exercise1.csv</em> via File → Import Data → CSV. Define variable types, then use Analyze → Descriptive Statistics to compute means and create histograms.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Compute summary statistics (mean, SD, quartiles) for each numeric variable.</li>
<li>Draw histograms for Weight_kg and SystolicBP and comment on their shapes.</li>
<li>Compare average blood pressure by sex.</li>
</ul>
</details>

<h2>2. AI-Assisted Teaching Activity</h2>
<details>
<summary>AI Activity Outline</summary>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Encourage students to use generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) as collaborative assistants for coding and interpretation while maintaining critical thinking.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pre-reading discussion:</strong> Provide short articles summarising AI’s potential and limitations in education. Discuss benefits such as additional resources and perspectives, and concerns like overreliance and accuracy.</li>
<li><strong>Prompt-writing workshop:</strong> Students work in pairs to write prompts asking ChatGPT to produce R or SPSS syntax for one of the datasets. They then refine the prompt to improve clarity.</li>
<li><strong>Execution & verification:</strong> Students run the AI-generated code and compare results to manual solutions or built-in functions. They check whether the AI code follows correct statistical practice and interpret results.</li>
<li><strong>Critical reflection:</strong> Groups share what worked well, identify mistakes made by the AI, and describe how they corrected them.</li>
<li><strong>Ethics & synthetic data discussion:</strong> Discuss why synthetic datasets are useful for teaching and privacy. Mention that synthetic data help simulate research scenarios, test algorithms, and protect privacy. Also discuss limitations such as potential data leakage or bias.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Alternative perspectives:</strong> You could use other AI tools, assign AI as a “virtual student” to critique, or ask students to compare AI explanations with textbook definitions.</p>
</details>

<h2>3. Interactive Quiz</h2>
<p>This quiz contains 25 questions. Students can click each question to reveal the answer.</p>
<div class="quiz-section">
<details>
<summary>1. Define descriptive statistics vs inferential statistics.</summary>
<p><em>Answer:</em> Descriptive statistics summarise and describe features of a dataset (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation). Inferential statistics use sample data to make generalisations about a population (e.g., confidence intervals, hypothesis tests).</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>2. What conditions are required for using an independent samples t-test?</summary>
<p><em>Answer:</em> Two independent groups, continuous outcome variable, approximately normally distributed within each group, and equal variances (or use Welch’s test for unequal variances).</p>
</details>
<!-- Add the remaining questions (3-25) here, each wrapped in <details> tags -->
</div>

<h2>4. Implementation Notes</h2>
<p><strong>Dataset distribution:</strong> Provide the CSV files or allow students to run the R scripts to create them. Synthetic datasets help protect privacy and support educational use.</p>
<p><strong>Software flexibility:</strong> Each exercise includes both SPSS and R instructions to build cross-platform skills.</p>
<p><strong>AI activity timing:</strong> Introduce the AI-assisted activity mid-semester when students have basic R/SPSS skills.</p>
<p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Use the quiz as a formative or summative assessment. Questions mix conceptual understanding and practical interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative resources:</strong> Consider using publicly available synthetic datasets (e.g., Health Gym, Synthea) for more complex projects or exploring other AI tools.</p>
